# Plex-Richpresence

> Note: This was heavily inspired from [Ombrelin's Plex Rich Presence](https://github.com/Ombrelin/plex-rich-presence) (a colleague in the same school as me ðŸ˜€) in Java. Since I disliked Java and the idea that I needed to install the right version of something, + because the multi-servers support was somewhat flaky, I decided to create mine in Golang.

# Downloads

Everything is available in the releases here: https://github.com/Arno500/plex-richpresence/releases

# Using

Download the latest binary [here](https://github.com/Arno500/plex-richpresence/releases), store it where you want and run it. That's it.  
If needed, the config file should be in your user folder, in an `Arno & Co` subfolder (`AppData/Roaming` in Windows, `.config` in Linux, etc...). It only stores Plex auth informations, to allow quickly running the app and get it working out-of-the-box.
Logs are also here, so if you need to open an issue, don't forget to include them! (and erase any potential sensitive informations like your Plex hostnames, etc...)  
You can also set some options in the tray icon, available in the notification area in Windows, or the tray area in macOS and various Linux DE.

# Building

You'll need GCC (even on Windows, unfortunately)

## Windows

`go build -tags windows -ldflags='-s -w -H=windowsgui'`

## Linux

`go build -tags unix -ldflags='-s -w'`

## MacOS

`go build -tags darwin -ldflags='-s -w'`

# Contributing

## Locales

I use https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n. Please follow their instructions to add a language file first. Be careful to pass the option `-format json` to have json files generated for you.

## Packaging

https://github.com/markbates/pkger is used to embed files in the executable itself, notably locale files. The package will detect the needed files when compiling the executable, so nothing to do here.

## Windows manifest

`rsrc -ico Plex_IDI_ICON1.ico -manifest plex-richpresence.manifest`
